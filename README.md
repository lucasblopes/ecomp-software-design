# Ecomp Activity and Financial Report System

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the Software Design course by our team. The system follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and incorporates the Facade and Builder design patterns. To ensure alignment with software engineering practices, we designed and implemented System Sequence Diagrams, Interaction Diagrams, and Class Diagrams.

The system's primary goal is to generate activity reports and financial reports for Ecomp. Additionally, the system manages projects and activities conducted by Ecomp.

## Usage

mvn compile
